Have you ever read a fantasy book that you can instantly visualize as a movie or a series? I definitely have. As someone with years of experience in the film industry, I tend to read books with a very visual lens â€“ when I read books, I play each chapter as a movie scene in my head, and I can specifically see how different characters would speak different lines. I can understand and visualize their intentions, and even as Iâ€™m actively reading, my brain is â€“ subconsciously â€“ breaking down what Iâ€™m reading and wondering how chapters can be restructured to fit the format of a film or TV show.
<br/><br/>
That being said, there are certainly some downsides to adapting your favourite books and series into visual media. The main downside, in my opinion, is that <b>there is no such thing as a casting choice that will appease every fan.</b> One of the wonderful things about books is that two people can read the exact same book and come away with wildly different interpretations and ideas of the main characters. This is one of the reasons why things like book clubs exist â€“ to discuss interpretations and opinions about scenes, characters, and their motivations. A prime example of a misstep with casting was putting Blake Lively in the role of Lily in the film adaptation of Colleen Hooverâ€™s It Ends With Us. Granted, I havenâ€™t heard anyone express satisfaction with this casting choice, but it goes to show how quickly a film or show adaptation can land in the trash â€“ before shooting even starts.
<br/><br/>
Note: maybe there is such thing as a casting choice that would appease every fan. Matthew Daddario as Azriel from A Court of Thorns & Roses series, anyone? From what Iâ€™ve heard on TikTok, it seems everyone agrees he would be an immaculate choice for this mysterious bat boy, written by Sarah J. Maas.
<br/><br/>
To circumvent this downside, this list is based on the approach that all these books would be <b>adapted into animated media.</b> A prime example: the Netflix limited series Arcane, which brilliantly featured two iconic League of Legends champions in a unique animated format. This series achieved 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, showcasing that animated series truly work. After all, there are some characters that we book lovers (especially those of us on BookTok) have fantasized into unobtainable dimensions of beauty. I hate to mention another example from ACOTAR, butâ€¦ no oneâ€™s good enough to play Rhysand. And if you beg to differ, let me know in the comments!
<br/><br/>
Without further ado, letâ€™s get into my list ðŸ‘‡

## 1. Legends & Lattes

<br/><br/>
Synopsis:
<br/><br/>
After a lifetime of bounties and bloodshed, Viv is hanging up her sword for the last time. The battle-weary orc aims to start fresh, opening the first ever coffee shop in the city of Thune. But old and new rivals stand in the way of success â€” not to mention the fact that no one has the faintest idea what coffee actually is. If Viv wants to put the blade behind her and make her plans a reality, she won't be able to go it alone. But the true rewards of the uncharted path are the travelers you meet along the way.
<br/><br/>
And whether drawn together by ancient magic, flaky pastry, or a freshly brewed cup, they may become partners, family, and something deeper than she ever could have dreamed.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree has bits of fantasy and worldbuilding, but it's interestingly mixed with a mundane premise: opening a coffee shop. And on top of that, the story is driven by heartfelt platonic relationships - and even a budding romantic relationship. It pulls from various genres, and is overall such a cozy read. It's advertised as "high fantasy with low stakes." I couldn't describe it better if I tried.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

As soon as I finished reading it, I KNEW it would work brilliantly as a limited series. Imagine this: 10 episodes revolving around an orc and a succubus building a coffee shop from the ground up, with each episode centering around a new issue, obstacle or creation that comes up in the book; for instance, an episode about the cinnamon buns, an episode about installing the air circulator, an episode about iced coffee, and so on. It would be the ultimate cozy watch. After all, I don't know about you, but I've been finding it hard to watch many movies and shows recently - everything just feels so high stakes and emotionally needy... if that makes sense. Watching two mythical creatures sipping and selling coffee sounds so much more pleasant and bearable. I think it would be a cute show to watch with other bookish friends who are looking for something that's easy and safe to watch!

## 2. The Shadow of the Gods

<br/><br/>
Synopsis:
<br/><br/>
Set in a brand-new, Norse-inspired world, and packed with myth, magic and bloody vengeance, The Shadow of the Gods begins an epic new fantasy saga from bestselling author John Gwynne.
<br/><br/>
After the gods warred and drove themselves to extinction, the cataclysm of their fall shattered the land of VigriÃ°. Now a new world is rising, where power-hungry jarls feud and monsters stalk the woods and mountains. A world where the bones of the dead gods still hold great power for those brave - or desperate - enough to seek them out.
<br/><br/>
Now, as whispers of war echo across the mountains and fjords, fate follows in the footsteps of three people: a huntress on a dangerous quest, a noblewoman who has rejected privilege in pursuit of battle fame, and a thrall who seeks vengeance among the famed mercenaries known as the Bloodsworn.
<br/><br/>
All three will shape the fate of the world as it once more falls under the shadow of the gods . . .
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
I should start by confessing: I only rated this book 3 stars on Goodreads. HOWEVER - I strongly believe this book (and the following two books of the Bloodsworn Saga, which isn't yet fully released) would work amazingly as animated films, especially if they're done with a unique style that fits the mythological, medieval, raw tone of the books - maybe something a bit more sketchy and choppy than a clean, smooth animation style.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

While suggesting this series to be adapted into a series of films may be a stark departure from the first suggestion on this list - and it is, I'm not arguing that - another crucial piece that this series has going for it is a STELLAR lead female character. Orka is badass and strong, and if you're someone who likes annotating books, you'll run through highlighter after highlighter from all the Orka quotes you'll be underlining. If I had the chance to see this character come to life through animation, defending her family and tearing people and creatures apart, I'd melt into a puddle within seconds.
<br/><br/>
One of the most captivating bits of worldbuilding in The Shadow of the Gods for me was - without a doubt - the city of Snakavik. This city was built within the skull of a colossal dead god. Yup. So cool, right? John Gwynne's imagery at this part of the book was refreshing, captivating, and I would be BEYOND thrilled to see Snakavik in an animated film.

alt="The Cruel Prince by Holly Black - Book Cover - Books That Should Be Adapted Into Movies or Series"
width="320px"></a>
<br/><br/>
Synopsis:
<br/><br/>
<i>Of course I want to be like them. Theyâ€™re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever. And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.</i>
<br/><br/>
Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.
<br/><br/>
To win a place at the Court, she must defy himâ€“and face the consequences.
As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Set within a world full of magical creatures, there's no better way to showcase the depth and creativity within Holly Black's The Cruel Prince series than an animated show. The fae courts, thrilling twists, and unique characters would work so perfectly on the screen, and it would be able to flawlessly attract some younger folk as well as older watchers. There's fantasy, political intrigue, a touch of romance, and complex relationships - what else do you need?

<br/><br/>

My journey with Holly Black started well over a decade ago with her Tithe series - each paperback book in that series was only CAD$10.50. Oh, the good ol' days when books were more affordable. I think Holly Black has a great affinity for bite-sized, magical stories centered around fae, and The Cruel Prince is a perfect addition to this repertoire (hence why it went so viral on BookTok).
<br/><br/>
And let's face it: Cardan has a tail. There's no way a real-life actor would be able to play Cardan - with a tail - and not have viewers burst out laughing. At least in an animated format, I think it would be a bit more plausible, and wouldn't take away from the immersion and relationship that's been built between viewers and the characters.

## 4. Neon Gods

<br/><br/>
Synopsis:
<br/><br/>
<i>He was supposed to be a myth. But from the moment I crossed the River Styx and fell under his dark spellâ€¦ he was, quite simply, mine.</i>
<br/><br/>
Society darling Persephone Dimitriou plans to flee the ultra-modern city of Olympus and start over far from the backstabbing politics of the Thirteen Houses. But all thatâ€™s ripped away when her mother ambushes her with an engagement to Zeus, the dangerous power behind their glittering cityâ€™s dark facade.
<br/><br/>
With no options left, Persephone flees to the forbidden undercity and makes a devilâ€™s bargain with a man she once believed a mythâ€¦ a man who awakens her to a world she never knew existed.
<br/><br/>
Hades has spent his life in the shadows, and he has no intention of stepping into the light. But when he finds that Persephone can offer a little slice of the revenge heâ€™s spent years craving, itâ€™s all the excuse he needs to help herâ€”for a price. Yet every breathless night spent tangled together has given Hades a taste for Persephone, and heâ€™ll go to war with Olympus itself to keep her closeâ€¦
<br/><br/>
A modern retelling of Hades and Persephone thatâ€™s as sinful as it is sweet.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Neon Gods by Katee Robert is certainly a step into more adult fantasy - especially when you consider the last item on this list. But as I read this romantasy retelling of Hades and Persephone from Greek mythology, I could already picture this as an animated film. There could be intense and dichotomous visual imagery to separate the Upper City from the Lower City - i.e. different colour schemes and even different animation styles. I can already imagine the dark, gritty, grungy vibes coupled with an impressive, pulsing soundtrack.

<br/><br/>

This animated film would be great for folk who read Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan as kids and grew into adulthood with a continuous love for fantasy and Greek mythology (raise your hand if this applies to you âœ‹), and for fans of 50 Shades of Grey, buttttt... this is better. Way better.
<br/><br/>
More than that, there's no way Neon Gods could be adapted into a live action film - for the same reason why ACOTAR can't be adapted into a live action series. There's no one on this planet good enough to play Hades.

width="320px"></a>
<br/><br/>
Synopsis:
<br/><br/>
<i>In this spellbinding debut novel, two estranged half-sisters tasked with guarding their family's library of magical books must work together to unravel a deadly secret at the heart of their collection--a tale of familial loyalty and betrayal, and the pursuit of magic and power.</i>
<br/><br/>
For generations, the Kalotay family has guarded a collection of ancient and rare books. Books that let a person walk through walls or manipulate the elements--books of magic that half-sisters Joanna and Esther have been raised to revere and protect.
<br/><br/>
All magic comes with a price, though, and for years the sisters have been separated. Esther has fled to a remote base in Antarctica to escape the fate that killed her own mother, and Joanna's isolated herself in their family home in Vermont, devoting her life to the study of these cherished volumes. But after their father dies suddenly while reading a book Joanna has never seen before, the sisters must reunite to preserve their family legacy. In the process, they'll uncover a world of magic far bigger and more dangerous than they ever imagined, and all the secrets their parents kept hidden; secrets that span centuries, continents, and even other libraries . . .
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
As someone with a Hungarian background, I mayyyy be biased when selecting this book to be part of my list. Maybe. I admit nothing.
<br/><br/>
I read this book cover to cover in a matter of hours, mainly because the main characters (and even the secondary characters) in this book are so well differentiated. So many books set in multiple point of views make no effort to separate each character's voice, but with each switch in perspective, I truly felt like I was placed in the mind of the respective character. Because of this, each character jumped off the page and I could see them in an animated series so clearly.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

Where Ink Blood Sister Scribe differentiates from other books on this list is in the genre. While this book is, undoubtedly, a fantasy book with undertones of trauma and grief, I felt a strong sense of "detective-ness" from this book. The plot was strong, twisting, and thrilling, and I felt like I was speculating on how the book would end just as much as the characters were. Because of this, I strongly believe this book would work great as a limited series, filled with a complex plot, meaningful relationships, and characters that leave you questioning whether you should like them or not.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

And that's my list! Without a doubt, there are so many other books and series that would excel at being adapted into animated films and shows. Leave some of your own suggestions in the comments below! I'd love to look through them and discuss with ya ðŸ˜Š
