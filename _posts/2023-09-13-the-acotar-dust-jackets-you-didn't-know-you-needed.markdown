If you've entered the world of BookTok lately (or even simply stepped inside a bookstore), odds are you've heard of the **A Court of Thorns and Roses series,** also dubbed ACOTAR. This bestselling series has sold millions of copies and is rumored to be in the process of being adapted to a TV series.
<br/><br/>
ACOTAR currently has five books:
<br/><br/>
1 - A Court of Thorns and Roses<br/>
2 - A Court of Mist and Fury<br/>
3 - A Court of War and Ruin<br/>
4 - A Court of Frost and Starlight<br/>
5 - A Court of Silver Flames
<br/><br/>
Sarah J. Maas, the author of ACOTAR and other bestselling series such as Throne of Glass and Crescent City, has confirmed that more books will be written for this series, but hasn't confirmed how many.
<br/><br/>
Each book in the ACOTAR series has received high ratings on Goodreads, the highest being A Court of Mist and Fury (book #2) at 4.64/5.
<br/><br/>
If you love romantasy (a genre that combines elements of romance and fantasy), then A Court of Thorns and Roses is a must read! It's one of my favorite series, though my top series of all time has to go to Sarah J. Maas's Throne of Glass series instead of ACOTAR. Nevertheless, I still treated myself to a dazzling set of dust jackets for my hardcover copies of ACOTAR, and they're beautifully displayed on a shelf in my bedroom. They're one of the last things I look at before I go to sleep, and one of the first things I see when I wake up

## The "Vintagely Classic" Dust Jacket Set for ACOTAR by <a href="https://www.booksknownoage.com/collections/dust-jackets/products/vinagely-classic-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses-dust-jacket-set-gold-foiled-officially-licensed">BooksKnowNoAge.com</a>

This dust jacket set is STUNNING. The base is black, but it's decorated with gold foil that shines in sunlight. Another thing I love about it is that it has a matte finish, which means it's soft to the touch - it doesn't feel cheap or plastic-y.

This dust jacket set gives me the perfect opportunity to showcase my love for ACOTAR and its characters, which are so brilliantly penned by Maas. From Feyre to Rhysand to Nesta to Lucien to Cassian (to name only a few), each character in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series is complex and compelling. I blew through this entire series in about a week (which is saying a lot, considering the longest book - A Court of Silver Flames - has an estimated word count of 226,343 words).

This set was designed by @RoadsToRuin, who also designed BooksKnowNoAge's <a href="https://www.booksknownoage.com/products/throne-of-glass-dust-jacket-set-vintagely-classic-gold-foiled-officially-licensed?pr_prod_strat=copurchase&pr_rec_id=8b16d4153&pr_rec_pid=8008063418625&pr_ref_pid=7943916814593&pr_seq=uniform.">Throne of Glass dust jacket set.</a> This set is in the same style as their ACOTAR set, so if you're looking to spice up your ACOTAR books and your Throne of Glass series, you should definitely grab both sets. I'm not sponsored and don't have any kind of partnership with BooksKnowNoAge - I just really love the quality of their dust jackets, and wanted to share them with you all!
