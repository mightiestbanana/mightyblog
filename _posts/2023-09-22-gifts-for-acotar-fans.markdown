If you‚Äôve ever landed yourself on BookTok, then you‚Äôve heard of the **A Court of Thorns and Roses series** (also called ACOTAR) written by Sarah J. Maas. This series has sold millions of copies, and for good reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs filled with complex, multi-dimensional characters, worldbuilding, and plot.
<br/><br/>
So far, ACOTAR has five books, but Sarah J. Maas has confirmed that more books will be added to the series in coming years. She‚Äôs currently devoting most of her focus to her Crescent City series.
<br/><br/>
Here are ACOTAR‚Äôs books at this point:
<br/><br/>

1 - A Court of Thorns and Roses<br/>
2 - A Court of Mist and Fury<br/>
3 - A Court of Wings and Ruin<br/>
4 - A Court of Frost and Starlight<br/>
5 - A Court of Silver Flames
<br/><br/>
Each book features exciting characters like Feyre, Elaine, Nesta, Rhysand, Cassian, and Azriel ‚Äì just to name a few. If you have someone in your life who _cannot_ stop talking about this series (no judgement ‚Äì I‚Äôm one of them), this list is for you!
<br/><br/>
I put together a list of some of the **best ACOTAR-related gifts and merch.** These would work great as birthday gifts or holiday presents‚Ä¶ and I might‚Äôve bought a few myself ü§´
<br/><br/>
P.S. ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sponsored by any websites or sellers. I‚Äôm just passionate about ACOTAR and the book community as a whole!
