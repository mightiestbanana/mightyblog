title: "8 Best Spicy Romantasy Books by Indie Authors"

As someone who loves to read romantasy books (books that combine elements from romance and fantasy genres), I’m always on the lookout for **books by indie authors.** After all, there’s only so many times I can re-read ACOTAR.
<br/><br/>
These last couple months, I’ve had the pleasure of reading a few books by indie authors. For my own purposes, I classify indie authors as any author that self-publishes their work OR is published by a very small publishing company.
<br/><br/>
Every book on this list is not only part of the romantasy genre but is also spicy. This means each book is meant to be read by adults, as they typically contain adult content. Makes sense, right? Before purchasing any of these books, I would recommend **researching any content warnings** just to make sure you’re prepared for the kind of spice each book provides.
<br/><br/>
Some of the most popular spicy romantasy books on the market right now are the A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J. Maas, Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros, From Blood and Ash by Jennifer L. Armentrout, and the Gods of Olympus series by Katee Robert. So if you love these spicy romantasy books, you’re in the right place!
<br/><br/>
Since the books in this list are written by indie authors, the majority of them aren’t for sale on sites that carry traditionally published books, like Indigo. I made sure to link every book to its Amazon listing, since that’s usually the most reputable (and cheapest) place to grab indie books!

### Synopsis:

Four beastly princes. One awkward bookworm. An enchanted world of fae, magic, and danger.
<br/><br/>
I’ve always loved fairytales. I never imagined I'd actually be in one.
<br/><br/>
When my father wanders into the enchanted realm of the fae, I know I have to go after him. And when he gets imprisoned, I'll do anything to save him... Even trade my freedom for his. I had no idea I'd end up imprisoned by four sexy fae who turn into beasts at night.
<br/><br/>
I have to win my freedom, and that means making a bargain with them. They must find their mates in order to break the curse. If I can help them do that, they'll set me free. Sounds simple, right?
<br/><br/>
It's not. Because against my better judgment, I'm starting to fall for these beastly princes. One is smart and sweet, the other mysterious and deadly, another flirty and confident, and the last prince... He's handsome, strong, has a wicked temper, and is dead-set against breaking the curse. Why does he want to keep me here forever?
<br/><br/>
But it's not just my freedom on the line. If I don't break the princes' curse soon, all the magic in the Enchanted Vale will be stolen by the evil—and stupidly hot—Prince of Thorns. And I'm not letting my princes stay cursed.
<br/><br/>
Not after I've fallen in love with them.
<br/><br/>
<em>BONDED BY THORNS is a steamy adult Beauty and the Beast retelling set in a fantasy fae realm. In this version, our beautiful bookworm doesn't have to choose between the four sexy fae princes. It is a full-length novel that ends on a cliffhanger. It includes MF and MM content. It is intended for mature readers only.</em>

### Synopsis:

<b>World Ender meets Ender of Worlds...</b><br/>
A thousand years ago, Dianna gave up her life in the deserts of Erioa to save her dying sister. She called upon anyone who would listen, not expecting a monster far worse than any nightmare to answer. Now she does what Kaden asks, even if that means securing an ancient relic from the very creatures that hunt her.
<br/><br/>
<b>A King thought long dead and long forgotten.</b><br/>
In the old world his name was Samkiel. In the new world it is Liam, but one title remains true throughout time. He is the World Ender, a myth to his enemies, a savior and King to those loyal to him. After the Gods War, he locked himself away, hiding from the world. He denied his crown and responsibilities, leaving the very ones who needed him most to deal with the fallout of the death of their homeworld. Now an attack on those he holds dear sends him back to the one realm he never wished to visit again and into the sights of an enemy he thought imprisoned eons ago.
<br/><br/>
Now enemies older than time must put aside their differences and work together in hopes of saving both their world and every realm in between.

Destiny or desire?

Where does your allegiance lie?

Every thought I have is treasonous. The way my hands ache to touch him deceitful.

Even my dreams make me a traitor to the kingdom I am sworn to protect.

### Synopsis:

On the worst birthday of my life, I come home to find my boyfriend in bed with another woman. Within hours, I’m drunk, homeless, and pledging to stay single forever. And that is when the dangerously sexy Seelie King rolls through town, looking for fae like me.
<br/><br/>
Every generation, the king holds a competition for Seelie queen. But for reasons he won’t explain, Torin is looking for a charade, not a real marriage. So when I drunkenly sling insults his way, I have his attention.
<br/><br/>
When Torin offers me fifty million to participate, I think, “What have I got to lose?” The answer turns out to be “my life,” because my competition will literally kill for the crown.
<br/><br/>
And the more time I spend with the seductive king, the harder it becomes to remember it’s all supposed to be fake. Now, my life—and my heart—are one the line.

width="250px"></a>

### Synopsis:

<em>Revenge.</em>
<br/><br/>
Raised to be my father’s weapon against the Coven that took away his sister and his birthright, I would do anything to protect my younger brother from suffering the same fate. My duty forces me to the secret town of Crystal Hollow and the prestigious Hollow’s Grove University—where the best and brightest of my kind learn to practice their magic free from human judgment.
<br/><br/>
There are no whispered words here. No condemnation for the blood that flows through my veins. The only animosity I face comes from the beautiful and infuriating Headmaster, Alaric Grayson Thorne, a man who despises me just as much as I loathe him and everything he stands for.
<br/><br/>
But that doesn’t mean secrets don’t threaten to tear the school in two. No one talks about the bloody massacre that forced it to close decades prior, only the opportunity it can afford to those fortunate enough to attend.
<br/><br/>
Because for the first time in fifty years, the Coven will open its wards to the Thirteen.
<br/><br/>
Thirteen promising students destined to change the world.
<br/><br/>
If the ghosts of Hollow’s Groves’ victims don’t kill them first.

<br/><br/>
His mistake.</em>
<br/><br/>
Raina Bloodgood has one desire: kill the Frost King and the Witch Collector who stole her sister. On Collecting Day, she means to exact murderous revenge, but a more sinister threat sets fire to her world. Rising from the ashes is the Collector, Alexus Thibault, the man she vowed to slay and the only person who can help save her sister.
<br/><br/>
Thrust into an age-old story of ice, fire, and ancient gods, Raina must abandon vengeance and aid the Witch Collector in saving the Frost King or let their empire—and her sister—fall into enemy hands. But the lines between good and evil blur, and Raina has more to lose than she imagined. What is she to do when the Witch Collector is no longer the villain who stole her sister, but the hero who’s stealing her heart?

For years, when I fell asleep, I dreamed of a man with blazing green eyes and a cruel smile.

The day I meet him, the ruthless mercenary leaves me for dead.
<br/><br/>
Just hours after humans are born, the gods take what little power we have. In return, they protect our borders from the vicious, merciless fae.
<br/><br/>
The humans who manage to keep their power are known as the corrupt.
And they are burned.
<br/><br/>
When my forbidden power is discovered, I’m forced to flee my tiny village and the life I adore.
<br/><br/>
To survive, I make a desperate bargain with the mercenary who abandoned me at my weakest.
<br/><br/>
Our deal is simple: I’ll help him and his mysterious friends sneak into the city. And he’ll help me learn to wield the strange, dark power I’ve always kept hidden. The power that may just be the key to my survival.
<br/><br/>
But the ruthless mercenary is hiding secrets of his own. Secrets that threaten the safety of everyone I love. Secrets that could tear this kingdom—and perhaps even this world—apart.
<br/><br/>
Please note: A Court This Cruel and Lovely is an NA/adult romantasy book with steam. While this series is slow burn, the chili pepper rating will increase for each book.
